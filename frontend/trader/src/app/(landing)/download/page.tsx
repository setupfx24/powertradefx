/**
 * Download / Install.
 *
 * The platform is web-based and ships as a PWA (see src/app/manifest.ts —
 * standalone display, /dashboard start URL, 192/512 icons). There are no
 * native store builds: IOS_APP_URL / ANDROID_APP_URL are empty in the
 * backend config, so this page deliberately links to NO App Store or
 * Play Store listing. Everything below describes what actually exists:
 * the browser platform and the add-to-home-screen install flow.
 *
 * The AppStoreButtons badge row that the (landing) layout used to render
 * under every page has been deleted — it linked to "#" because no native
 * app exists, which is exactly what this page explains. Re-add a store
 * badge row here, wired to real listing URLs, if native apps ever ship.
